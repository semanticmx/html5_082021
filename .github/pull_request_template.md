## Media types (MIME types)

In the following PR, we are going to address MIME Types. MIME Types are unique identifiers for file formats. They are intended to provide a hint on how to interpret data.

## Why do we need MIME types?

When a web browser renders a web page, they look into the head tag to know what kind of data should interpret. In other words, we need MIME type to tell how should the web browser render the data.
