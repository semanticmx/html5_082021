## Chapter 1: MIME TYPES

MIME Type is an identifier for file formats. They're intended to provide a hint on how to interpret the data.

Examples: 
text/html for HTML documents 
text/plain for plain text
text/cdd for CSS documents
text/javascript for JavaScript files

The syntax to indicate a HTML file used to be like this:
```<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html"; charset="utf-8">```

But now, in HTML5 it has been shortenend to: 
```<meta charset="utf-8">```
