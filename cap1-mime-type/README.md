## HTML5 MIME type

MIME types Are unique identifiers for file formats, it helps to indicate to the browser how to interpret data.

MIME types are specified in the HTTP's request header or the ```<head>```tag, using accept attribute or content-type attribute.

Examples:
- text/html for HTML documents
- text/plain for plain text
- text/cdd for CSS documents
- text/javascript for JavaScript files


### Examples 

To specify HTML media type, the following syntax used to be used:

```
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html"; charset="utf-8">
</head>
```  

But now, in HTML5 has been shortenend to:

```<meta charset="utf-8">```
